#Symbiolab centrifuge

##Overview
Symbiolab centrifuge is a DIY project still in development for Symbiolab at institute IRNAS. The centrifuge is based on our very own Symbiolab driver PCB on which a repository will be created in a short future. The whole centrifuge, besides the PCB, is made of cheap and easy accsesible parts, like brushless motors, and lasercut or 3D printed parts.
